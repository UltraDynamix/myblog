# Pointers in C++

>  **a pointer is a integer, a number, which stores a memory address.**

The memory in our computer is just like a street of house, no opposite, just a linear, every house on that street is got a address, picture the every house that has a address is a **byte**, it is **one byte of data**, we observably need to address every home, so that the deliver can find the right house.

So, pointer is the **address**, which **tells us where the house is, where the specific byte of memory is.** this is extremely important, because every thing we do in our code, is **going to reading or writing from and to our memory.** You don't necessarily need to use pointer, **However pointer is extremely useful tool**. 

**A pointer is just an address. It is a integer which holds a memory address.**
